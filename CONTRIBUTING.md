# Contributing to the Spotify Now Playing Twitch Extension

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! üôè

## Important Note Regarding Twitch Policies ‚ö†Ô∏è

Twitch's Developer Agreement and policies prohibit Extensions that encourage or facilitate the broadcasting of music for which the broadcaster does not have the necessary rights or licenses.

Because this extension displays currently playing music, adding features that might encourage broadcasters to play specific songs they don't have the rights to (e.g., song request systems, direct playback controls linked to requests) would violate these policies.

Therefore, **contributions related to features that could encourage unlicensed music playback cannot be accepted.**

## How You Can Contribute (Limited Scope)

While feature contributions related to music selection are restricted due to the policies mentioned above, contributions in other areas might be considered:

* **Bug Reports:** If you find a bug in the existing functionality (e.g., display issues, errors connecting/disconnecting, problems with the history), please feel free to open an issue on GitHub detailing the problem, steps to reproduce, and your environment. üêõ
* **Code Quality / Refactoring:** Suggestions or pull requests for improving code quality, fixing typos, or refactoring existing code *without changing the core functionality* may be considered.
* **UI/UX Tweaks:** Minor suggestions or improvements to the existing user interface (panel or config) that *do not* violate the music policies.

**Please open an issue first** to discuss any potential changes before submitting a pull request, especially if it involves more than a minor bug fix.

## Reporting Issues

* Use the GitHub Issues tab for the repository.
* Provide a clear title and description.
* Include steps to reproduce the issue.
* Mention your browser, operating system, and extension version if relevant.

I appreciate your understanding regarding the limitations imposed by platform policies. Thank you for helping to keep the extension compliant!
